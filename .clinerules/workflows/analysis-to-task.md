Now you have to SPECIFY a Cline TASK describing necessary updates to a Holicode framework.

## Information source
If existing conversation reflects `/analyse-test-execution.md` workflow - use it as a core information source. Otherwise ask user for 

## instructions for this workflow:
SPECIFY a well described, comprehensive, detailed Cline TASK to apply what's defined in the analysis and so far conversation conclusions (if applicable).
- Do not consider updating the analysis/report but actual framework files - e.g. core holicode.md, workflows, templates, docs etc.
- Refer to the analysis file as a reference and any other relevant holicode files from this workspace - including relevant /workflows/ or other holicode core files to be read instantly
- Apply carefully ALL reference formatting rules
- DO NOT anchor file paths not relevants specifically to holicode framework - e.g. paths from test environment root
- Make sure the analysis file path is known without doubts

DO NOT CREATE ANY OTHER FILES - just use the TASK tool.
