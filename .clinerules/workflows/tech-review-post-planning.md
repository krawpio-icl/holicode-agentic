# Post-Planning Technical Review Workflow

## Agent Identity
Role: Principal Technical Reviewer  
Responsibilities: Validate technical decisions against business requirements, security, and operational needs  
Success Criteria: Comprehensive review report with risk assessment and recommendations  
What/Why/How Focus: Validate HOW aligns with WHY across all technical decisions

## Purpose
Provide systematic self-critic review after technical design phase to ensure:
- Business requirements alignment
- Security coverage adequacy
- Reliability requirements met
- Cost implications understood
- Operational complexity manageable

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
- [ ] All TD documents (TD-001 through TD-XXX) created
- [ ] Business context (productContext.md) available
- [ ] Delegation settings checked (techContext.md or delegationContext.md)
- [ ] Success metrics defined in projectbrief.md

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Technical alignment score calculated
- [ ] Security review completed with findings
- [ ] Reliability assessment documented
- [ ] Cost analysis provided (if applicable)
- [ ] Operational complexity evaluated
- [ ] Risk matrix generated
- [ ] Recommendations provided
- [ ] Review report created in `.holicode/analysis/reports/`
- [ ] If critical issues found, handoff created for resolution

## Process

### 1. Load and Analyze Technical Context
```markdown
## Context Loading
1. Read all TD documents from `.holicode/specs/technical-design/`
2. Load productContext.md for business requirements
3. Load systemPatterns.md for architectural constraints
4. Check delegation settings to determine approval requirements
```

### 2. Business Alignment Assessment
```markdown
## Business Alignment Checklist
- [ ] Each business goal has corresponding technical solution
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable through technical design
- [ ] User personas' needs addressed by architecture
- [ ] Constraints (budget, timeline, resources) respected
- [ ] MVP scope appropriately bounded

### Alignment Scoring
- **Full Alignment (90-100%)**: All business needs addressed
- **Good Alignment (70-89%)**: Most needs met, minor gaps
- **Partial Alignment (50-69%)**: Significant gaps requiring attention
- **Poor Alignment (<50%)**: Major redesign needed
```

## When to Engage Stakeholders

### Always Require Human Review
- Critical security findings
- Business alignment < 70%
- Cost overrun > 20%
- Major architectural changes suggested

### Conditional Review (Check Delegation)
- Medium security issues
- Minor reliability gaps
- Alternative approaches identified
- Trade-off decisions needed

### Automated Approval Allowed
- All scores > 85%
- No critical issues
- Within budget/timeline
- Delegation explicitly granted
```

## Error Handling
- Missing TD documents: Report gap and continue with available
- Unclear requirements: Flag for clarification
- Conflicting constraints: Document and escalate

## Example Execution

# Read all TD documents
for td in .holicode/specs/technical-design/TD-*.md; do
  echo "Loading: $td"
done

# Check delegation settings
if [ -f ".holicode/state/delegationContext.md" ]; then
  echo "Delegation context loaded"
fi
```

- Risk mitigation requirements
- Approved/conditional approval status
- Any required design updates

## Workflow Invocation
This workflow is typically invoked after technical-design.md completes:

```bash
# Execute review after technical design
/tech-review-post-planning.md

# Review will:
# 1. Load all TD documents
# 2. Assess against business requirements
# 3. Perform security/reliability review
# 4. Generate comprehensive report
# 5. Determine GREEN/YELLOW/RED status
```

## Success Metrics
- 100% of technical designs reviewed before implementation
- >90% accuracy in finding architectural and security issues
- Clear GREEN/YELLOW/RED decision paths
- Review reports actionable with specific recommendations
